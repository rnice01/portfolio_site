                <h3>A Scandal in Django</h3>
                <h4>After a Long Day</h4>
                <p>My wife was making homemade bath bombs and selling them through a Facebook store page. But I wanted to create a brand for her with a professional looking web site where she could display her bath bombs and communicate with her customers through a blog and testimonials. What led me to use Django was the Admin page feature that comes baked in with the framework. This feature would allow my wife to easily update her bath bomb inventory as well as write blogs. I used Bootstrap 4 beta to create a responsive and clean shopping experience for the users. There's also some front end focused features to allow seamless updates for the use without any page refresh like adding items to their cart, editing their cart, and commenting on blog posts.</p>

                <h3>A Study in Ruby</h3>
                <h4>Postagram</h4>
                <p>The Ruby and Rails communities are amazing,
                  I have learned so many great things about Software Development
                  from peple like Sandi Metz, Peter Cooper, and the folks at Thoughbot.
                  Furthermore, I love the Ruby language, so creating a Rails project
                  was a no brainer for me. I was following a couple of different
                  tutorials to get the project on its feet, the primary one being
                  Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl. Once I had the user accounts implemented
                  I was excited to venture off on my own. Some feature I have included: authenticated
                  users can create posts and like posts, all users can view other users and posts. Posts
                  are displayed on the posts overview page by most recent and most liked. So far the likes
                  feature is one that I enjoyed the most with this app, it uses polymorphic associations
                  so I can have users like just about anything I want in the app. I blogged about my experience
                  <a href="https://medium.com/@rnice4christ/i-added-a-likes-feature-to-my-app-the-wrong-way-part-1-polymorphic-associations-ff94484c4634">
                    here</a>. I also explored boosting performance of my app by using Rails' super easy to use caching, which
                    also gives me the benefit of keeping my database provisioned on Heroku getting hit with a lot of queries.
                    It was a great experience overall and I'm excited to be working on more Rails applications and continuing
                    to add new features to this one.
