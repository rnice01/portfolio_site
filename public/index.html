                <h3>A Scandal in Django</h3>
                <h4>After a Long Day</h4>
                <p>My wife was making homemade bath bombs and selling them through a Facebook store page. But I wanted to create a brand for her with a professional looking web site where she could display her bath bombs and communicate with her customers through a blog and testimonials. What led me to use Django was the Admin page feature that comes baked in with the framework. This feature would allow my wife to easily update her bath bomb inventory as well as write blogs. I used Bootstrap 4 beta to create a responsive and clean shopping experience for the users. There's also some front end focused features to allow seamless updates for the use without any page refresh like adding items to their cart, editing their cart, and commenting on blog posts.</p>

                <h3>A Study in Ruby</h3>
                <h4>Postagram</h4>
                <p>The Ruby and Rails community is amazing, I have learned so many great things about Software Development from peple like Sandi Metz and Peter Cooper. Furthermore, I love the Ruby language, so creating a Rails project was a no brainer for me. There's something about forums that I just really enjoy: there's drama (a little too much at times), laughter, wisdom being passed down, and people just being able to share their interests with others. The styling is done with Bootstrap 3</p>
